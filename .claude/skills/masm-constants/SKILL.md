# MASM Constant Conventions

## Placement

Constants must be defined at the **top of the file**, before any procedure definitions, but after imports or type aliases.

## Organization

### Constants Section (first)

Group non-error constants by topic. Use blank lines between sections. Common topics:

- **Slot names** – use `word("path::to::slot")` for slot identifiers
- **Memory pointer offsets** – offsets into memory regions
- **Local memory offsets** – offsets within a procedure's local memory
- **Magic numbers / values** – domain-specific literals
- **Event identifiers** – `event("...")` constants consumed by `emit` (e.g. `const AUTH_REQUEST_EVENT = event("miden::protocol::auth::request")` used as `emit.AUTH_REQUEST_EVENT`)
- **Trace ids** – plain numeric constants consumed by `trace` (e.g. `const PRINTLN = 0` used as `trace.PRINTLN`); `trace` takes a numeric `u32` id, **not** an `event("...")` constant

Order sections by dependency or by usage frequency. Put the most widely used first.

### Errors Section (after constants)

Errors (panic/assert error codes, e.g. `ERR_*`) go in a **dedicated "errors" section**, placed after the constants section. Define them with string values describing the error. (Some files in v0.15 place the errors section before the constants section; constants-first is the more common order and is preferred for new files.)

## Naming

### Memory Pointers

Memory pointer constants describe offsets into memory regions that are shared or global (e.g. layout of a memory region, input/output structure offsets). They are **not** scoped to a single procedure.

```masm
# Good: descriptive, shared usage
const ASSET_OFF = 0
const AMOUNT_OFF = 1
const NOTE_DATA_LEN = 16

# Or grouped by memory region if applicable
const INPUT_PTR_OFF = 0
const INPUT_LEN_OFF = 1
```

### Local Memory Offsets

Local memory offsets describe offsets within a procedure's local memory. Name them with **UPPERCASE descriptive names ending in `_LOC` (or `_LOCAL`)**:

```masm
# Good: descriptive UPPERCASE name ending in _LOC
const IS_SIGNER_FOUND_LOC = 0
const CURRENT_SIGNER_INDEX_LOC = 1
const NUM_OF_APPROVERS_LOC = 0
```

When several procedures in the same file define local offsets, **group each procedure's locals under a section comment** and, where names would otherwise collide or be ambiguous, disambiguate with an UPPERCASE context prefix derived from the procedure name. Not every constant in a group needs the prefix — use it only where it adds clarity:

```masm
# bridge_out memory locals
const BRIDGE_OUT_BURN_ASSET_LOC = 0
const DESTINATION_NETWORK_LOC   = 13
const BRIDGE_OUT_IS_NATIVE_LOC  = 14

# create_burn_note memory locals
const CREATE_BURN_NOTE_BURN_ASSET_LOC = 0
const ATTACHMENT_LOC                  = 8
```

Do **not** use a lowercase procedure-name prefix (e.g. `validate_note_NOTE_IDX_LOC`); that form does not appear in the protocol source. Every constant name in v0.15 source begins with an uppercase letter.

The uppercase rule is assembler-enforced, not just stylistic: `miden-assembly-syntax` (0.25.x, `ident.rs`) rejects any constant identifier containing a lowercase letter — constant names may use only uppercase ASCII letters, digits, and underscores, and must start with a letter. A lowercase-prefixed constant fails to assemble.

## Formatting

Both `const NAME = value` (spaces around `=`) and `const NAME=value` (no spaces) occur in the source, but the spaced form now dominates: at protocol head `b414de2d` the `.masm` sources contain 975 spaced definitions vs 111 no-space. **Use spaces around the equals sign** for new or edited constants. Do not treat no-space definitions in existing files as errors, but keep a file internally consistent with its surrounding style.

**Errors** – string value describing the error:
```masm
const ERR_BRIDGE_NOT_MAINNET = "bridge not mainnet"
const ERR_UNAUTHORIZED = "unauthorized"
```

**Slots** – use `word()` with the slot path; mark them `pub const` when the slot is part of a component's public storage layout:
```masm
pub const THRESHOLD_CONFIG_SLOT = word("miden::standards::auth::multisig::threshold_config")
pub const AUTHORITY_SLOT = word("miden::standards::access::authority")
```

**Offsets / numeric values** – plain numbers:
```masm
const IS_SIGNER_FOUND_LOC = 0
const CURRENT_SIGNER_INDEX_LOC = 1
```

## Visibility (`pub const`)

In v0.15 a constant must be declared `pub const` to be referenced from another module. This is **not** limited to storage slots: any constant imported elsewhere via `use path::to::CONST` (or referenced as `module::CONST`) must be `pub`, including magic numbers, memory-pointer offsets, and event identifiers. Keep purely file-local constants as plain `const`.

```masm
# pub because they are imported by other modules
pub const MAX_ASSETS_PER_NOTE = 64
pub const AUTH_REQUEST_EVENT = event("miden::protocol::auth::request")

# file-local only — no pub needed
const IS_SIGNER_FOUND_LOC = 0
```

## Example Layout

```masm
# CONSTANTS
# =================================================================================================

# Storage slots
pub const AUTHORITY_SLOT = word("miden::standards::access::authority")

# Authority modes
const AUTH_CONTROLLED = 0
const OWNER_CONTROLLED = 1
const RBAC_CONTROLLED = 2

# Memory pointers
const ASSET_OFF = 0
const AMOUNT_OFF = 1

# bridge_out memory locals
const BRIDGE_OUT_BURN_ASSET_LOC = 0
const DESTINATION_NETWORK_LOC   = 13
const BRIDGE_OUT_IS_NATIVE_LOC  = 14

# create_burn_note memory locals
const CREATE_BURN_NOTE_BURN_ASSET_LOC = 0
const ATTACHMENT_LOC                  = 8

# ERRORS
# =================================================================================================

const ERR_BRIDGE_NOT_MAINNET = "bridge not mainnet"
const ERR_UNAUTHORIZED = "unauthorized"
const ERR_NOTE_NOT_FOUND = "note not found"

# PROCEDURES
# =================================================================================================

pub proc validate_note
    ...
end
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All constants defined at top of file (after imports / type aliases)
- [ ] Errors in dedicated section, placed after the constants section (constants-first preferred)
- [ ] Non-error constants grouped by topic with blank lines between sections
- [ ] Memory pointers (shared/global) use descriptive names
- [ ] Local memory offsets use UPPERCASE names ending in `_LOC`/`_LOCAL`, grouped under a per-procedure section comment when multiple procedures define locals
- [ ] No lowercase procedure-name prefix on local offset constants
- [ ] Constants referenced from another module are declared `pub const`; file-local constants stay plain `const`
- [ ] Prefer spaces around `=` for new/edited constants (existing files may be no-space; keep file consistent)
- [ ] Section comments used to label topic groups
