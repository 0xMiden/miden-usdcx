# MASM Padding Conventions

## Overview

Miden assembly has five invocation instructions, which fall into two stack-discipline classes:

| Class | Instructions | Stack behavior | Padding convention |
|-------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Same context** (inline) | `exec`, `dynexec` | Share the caller's operand stack; no depth-16 boundary | Follows the caller — no required pad-to-16 |
| **Context switch** | `call`, `dyncall`, `syscall` | New/return context; on entry the visible stack is set to depth 16, and on return the depth must be *exactly* 16 or the VM traps | Inputs/Outputs documented to 16 with `pad(N)` (prevailing convention) |

The difference between `dynexec` and `dyncall` is the same as the difference between `exec` and `call`: the `dyn` variants only differ from the static ones in that the call target is resolved dynamically from the stack at runtime. `dynexec` does NOT context-switch — it inlines into the caller's context just like `exec`.

`syscall` is the same as `call` mechanically (it context-switches and truncates the visible stack to 16), except the target must be a procedure in the program's kernel and execution returns to the root context.

## Stack Depth Floor: 16

Miden VM enforces a minimum operand-stack depth of 16 elements (`MIN_STACK_DEPTH = 16` in the VM core). When an operation would naively shrink the stack below 16, the VM auto-fills the missing positions with zeros via the overflow-table mechanism. The actual depth stays exactly 16; only the visible content shrinks.

This invariant applies at the entry/return boundary of the **context-switching** invocations:

- `call`, `dyncall`, and `syscall` procedures (the visible stack is set to 16 on entry, and must be exactly 16 on return or the VM traps),
- note scripts and transaction scripts (entered via `dyncall` at depth 16).

> Note: for `dyncall`, the stack is shifted left by one element (the consumed MAST-root pointer) before being set to 16.

It does NOT apply to the **same-context** invocations `exec` and `dynexec`, which share the caller's stack and can drop the visible count below 16 by consuming caller elements (see Danger Zone).

### Tracking the floor in inline comments

When the naive math would put the stack below 16, the `# =>` tracker must reflect the actual auto-padded depth, not the naive count.

```masm
# entry at depth 16: [VALUE, pad(12)]
dropw
# => [pad(16)]   # correct: VALUE replaced with zeros, depth still 16
```

Not:

```masm
# => [pad(12)]   # wrong: depth is still 16, only the visible content shrank
```

This shows up most often at the start of note scripts that don't use their input arguments:

```masm
@note_script
pub proc main
    dropw
    # => [pad(16)]
    ...
end
```

Standard note scripts are MASM library procs annotated with `@note_script` (`pub proc main … end`), not bare `begin … end` programs. Bare `begin … end` is still valid MASM, but only at the top-level kernel/tx-script program entry.

## Context-Switching Procedures (`call`, `dyncall`, `syscall`)

The VM hard-requires the visible stack depth to be exactly 16 when a context-switching procedure returns; otherwise the VM traps. To make this explicit, the prevailing convention is to document Inputs/Outputs padded to 16 with `pad(N)`:
1. **Doc comments** (`#!`) for Inputs/Outputs
2. **Inline comments** (`#`) showing stack state

### Doc Comment Format

Use `pad(N)` notation where N + other elements = 16:

```masm
#! Inputs:  [ASSET_KEY, ASSET_VALUE, pad(8)]
#! Outputs: [pad(16)]
#!
#! Invocation: call
pub proc receive_asset
```

This is a strong convention, not an absolute documentation rule. Some standard `call` procedures document only their *logical* stack (fewer than 16 elements, no `pad`) — for example multisig accessors document `Inputs: [index]` / `Outputs: [PUB_KEY, scheme_id]`. Prefer `pad(N)`-to-16 for new code, but do not flag logical-only documentation on an existing `call`/`dyncall`/`syscall` proc as a bug.

### Inline Comment Format

Track padding through the procedure:

```masm
exec.native_account::add_asset
# => [ASSET_VALUE', pad(12)]

# drop the final asset
dropw
# => [pad(16)]
```

## Same-Context Procedures (`exec`, `dynexec`)

Procedures invoked with `exec` or `dynexec` share the caller's stack directly, so their padding follows whatever the caller establishes — there is no depth-16 boundary to satisfy.

Most `exec`/`dynexec` procedures document only their logical inputs/outputs, without explicit padding:

```masm
#! Inputs:  [PUB_KEY, scheme_id]
#! Outputs: []
#!
#! Invocation: exec
pub proc authenticate_transaction
```

The same holds for `dynexec` — e.g. the `TokenPolicyManager` faucet policies document logical I/O (`Inputs: [amount, tag, note_type, RECIPIENT]` for a mint policy; `Inputs: [ASSET_KEY, ASSET_VALUE]` / `Outputs: []` for a burn policy), exactly like `exec`.

The exception is when the caller itself works in a padded-to-16 context: then the `exec`/`dynexec` proc documents `pad(N)`-to-16 to match the caller. The kernel transaction API does this — its `dynexec` procedures pad to 16 (e.g. `account_get_initial_commitment` documents `Inputs: [pad(16)]` / `Outputs: [INIT_COMMITMENT, pad(12)]`) because the surrounding caller convention is padded. Padding for same-context procedures is dictated by the caller, not by the invocation instruction.

### Why Padding Follows the Caller

`exec` / `dynexec` procedures share the caller's stack directly. Imposing a fixed pad would be misleading because:
- The actual stack may have additional elements from the caller
- The procedure may consume caller's stack elements

### Danger Zone

If an `exec` or `dynexec` procedure's stack falls below the elements it expects, it will consume stack items from its caller, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. This is a bug and should be fixed by ensuring the procedure maintains sufficient stack depth and avoiding dropping more stack elements than available.

### Example of Dangerous Behavior

```masm
# => [num_approvers, threshold]
dropw # dropw drops 4 elements, which will result in "negative" stack consumption (consuming 2 elements from the caller's stack)
```


## Intermediate States

Inside a procedure, the stack may temporarily exceed 16 elements:

```masm
# => [num_approvers, threshold, MULTISIG_CONFIG, pad(12)]
#     ^--- 18 elements total, must be reduced before return
```

For context-switching procedures these extra elements must be explicitly dropped before the procedure returns (directly or via called procedures), so the visible depth is exactly 16 on return.

## Debugging Stack Depth

When unsure whether the stack matches the depth you expect, use the assembly's debug instructions to inspect it at runtime. These cost zero VM cycles and do not affect the program hash.

- `debug.stack` – print the full operand stack.
- `debug.stack.N` – print only the top N elements. N is a `u8` (syntactic range `0..=255`); the useful range for "top N" is `1..=255`. `debug.stack.0` is accepted and prints the whole operand stack (equivalent to `debug.stack`).
- `sdepth` – push the current stack depth onto the stack as a felt; useful when you need depth as a runtime value, e.g. to assert it:

  ```masm
  sdepth push.16 eq assert.err="depth must be 16 here"
  ```

Debug instructions run when the program is executed with debug mode enabled. The `miden-vm run` command runs with debug mode enabled by default — just run the program to see their output:

```bash
miden-vm run program.masm
```

Pass `--release` (`-r`) to disable debug instructions (release mode):

```bash
miden-vm run program.masm --release
```

Debug instructions are compiled into the MAST as decorators (they are not stripped at compile time). When debug mode is disabled they are skipped at execution time — i.e. not executed — rather than removed. Remove or comment out `debug.*` lines before committing production MASM.

## Validation Checklist

For all invocation types:
- [ ] Inline `# =>` trackers reflect the post-auto-pad depth (never below 16) at the context-switch boundaries that enforce the floor (`call`, `dyncall`, `syscall`, note scripts, tx scripts)
- [ ] No `debug.*` instruction is left in production MASM

For context-switching procedures (`call`, `dyncall`, `syscall`):
- [ ] On return, the visible stack depth is exactly 16 (the VM traps otherwise)
- [ ] Inputs/Outputs doc comments prefer `pad(N)`-to-16; logical-only documentation on existing procs is acceptable, not a bug
- [ ] Inline comments use `# =>` format with `pad(N)` notation
- [ ] All intermediate states track the full stack including padding

For same-context procedures (`exec`, `dynexec`):
- [ ] Padding follows the caller — logical (un-padded) I/O when the caller is logical; `pad(N)`-to-16 when the caller works in a padded-to-16 context (e.g. kernel API `dynexec` procs)
- [ ] Verify the stack never drops below the elements the procedure expects, so it does not consume the caller's stack
